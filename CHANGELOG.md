Welcome to the April 25, 2023 release of loopback4-audit-log. There are many updates in this version that we hope you will like, the key highlights include:

  - [Add Audit Log Mixin Wrapper Around Audit Log Mixin](https://github.com/sourcefuse/loopback4-audit-log/issues/57) :- [feat(mixin): add conditional audit repository mixin ](https://github.com/sourcefuse/loopback4-audit-log/commit/10257b6094df79497d30084cc42f3e15eef34e0c) was commited on April 25, 2023 by [Sunny Tyagi](mailto:107617248+Tyagi-Sunny@users.noreply.github.com)
    
      - To be used when the actual audit mixin is to be applied conditionally from the
      
      - flag from the environment variables
      
      - rather than the code.
      
      -  BREAKING CHANGE:
      
      - Audit Repository Mixin return type changed and now is being
      
      - returned as an abstract class. This
      
      - doesn&#39;t affect 99% of the users because in
      
      - crud repositories this mixin is already applied on the base class. Only those
      
      - who are directly assigning the mixin-ed class to some variable will have the
      
      - type error showing them.
